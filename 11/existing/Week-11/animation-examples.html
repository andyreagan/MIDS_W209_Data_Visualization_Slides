of a Peer to Peer Network</a><br />
Rachna Dhamija, Danyel Fisher, Ka-Ping Yee (UC Berkeley)<br />
Network analysis visualization, interaction assisted by animation</p>

Golan Levin, et. al. (for New Radio and Performing Arts, Inc.)<br />
This one takes some effort, but it's a nice example of animation working with interaction. Note: this is a java applet. You may need to change your java security settings if viewing it on a Mac. (Go to System Preferences/Java/Security, enable java content in the browser, set security level to Medium). </p>

This one is more art than information, but we'll see it again in the aesthetics module.</p>

Samuel Huron, Romain Vuillemot, and Jean-Daniel Fekete (INRIA)<br />
An example of the Visual Sedimentation library, which enables a particular animation effect that can be applied (with caution) to many graph types.</p>

Here an animation reveals complex organizational changes over time</p>

This is a scientific visualization, so not technically within the scope of this class, but it's interesting to see how animation gets used in this community. The annual Supercomputing (SC) conference has a visualization showcase, and almost every entry is animated. This one, from SC13, is mesmerizing.</p>
